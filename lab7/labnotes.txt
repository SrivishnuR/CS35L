Encryption types:

Symmetric Key Encryption
a.k.a shared/secret key
Key used to encrypt is same key as used to decrypt

Asymmetric Key Encryption: Public/Private
2 different (but realtaed) keys: public and private
Only creator knows the relation. Private key cannot be derived from public key

Public-key Encryption (Asymmetric)

Uses a pair of keys for encryption

Public key - Published and known to everyone
Private key - Secret key known only to the owner

Encryption
	Use public key of reciever to encrypt
	Use private key of reciever to decrypt

Host validation
Client asks server to prove that it is the owner of te public key using asymmetric encryption.
Encrypt a message with given public key
If server is the true owner, it can decrypt the message with the private key
If everything works, host is successfully validated.

Session Encryption
Client and server agree on symmetric encryption key (session key)
This session key is communicated using asymmetric encryption.

Client authentication
password-based authentication
Prompt for password on remote server
If username specified exists and remote password for it is correct then the system lets you in

Key-based authentication
Generate a key pair on the client
Copy the public key to the server (~/.ssh/authorized_keys)
Server authenticates client if it can demonstrate
