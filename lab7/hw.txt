Homework questions

### Question 1 ###
It would be fine if the other teams had been observing all the bytes going across the network 
as they cannot decrypt the data without the private key, passcodes and passphrases.

1) If the teams had tapped our keystrokes, the network is not secure, as while the transfer 
of messages throughout the network are secure, the ends are not, and the other team can learn 
passwords and passphrases throughout the keystrokes.

2) If the other teams had temporary physical control of the USB, it would not be secure as they would have access to our private key.

### Question 2 ###
