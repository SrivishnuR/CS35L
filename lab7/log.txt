Lab 7 Log

In Ubuntu Terminal

Server steps
dpkg --get-selections | grep openssh // This is used to check if openssh-server and openssh-client is installed
sudo apt-get install openssh-server // openssh-server is not installed, so we install it
ssh-keygen // Create a keygen. Default saved to (/home/ubuntu/.ssh/id_rsa). Enter a password. Mine is turtles.
cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa // This is done to see the encryption key
sudo useradd -d /home/lab7 -m bigturtle // We now create an account and folder for the client bigturtle on the server
sudo passwd bigturtle // We now set the password for the client bigturtle. The password is smallturtle.
cd /home/lab7 // CD into the client's folder on the server
sudo mkdir .ssh // Make a directory called .ssh in this folder
sudo chown -R bigturtle .ssh // Give ownership to bigturtle
sudo chmod 700 .ssh // Give permissions to bigturtle
ifconfig // Get the ip address of the server so the client can ping it

Client steps
ssh-keygen // Generate a public and private key pair
ssh-copy-id -i bigturtle@10.97.85.125 // Copy public key to the server for key-based authentication. Enter bigturtle's password smallturtle here.
ssh-add // Add private key to authentication agent (ssh-agent)
ssh -X bigturtle@10.97.85.125 // SSH to server (with X11 session forwarding), and put the keygen password in 
so the client can use the private key to decrypt the message the server sends so that we can create a secure 
connection.
firefox // Now the client can run programs on the server!
xterm
ps -ef | grep xterm // Shows that the client is now using the xterm process!
