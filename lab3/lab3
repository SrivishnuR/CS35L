Using python and java in unix

Use python in shell to access python

type 
exit() to exit python

look at variable.py example for basic python operations

type
python variable.py
to run variable.py

you can also create an intermediate file with python as well and when you run that it is faster than running the script from the start

If you take out the comma in the print then the pharenteses is not shown

In functions in python, the arguments can be in any order as long as it is sent in the way as

printDetails(name="Vishnu", age="20")

Lists are essentially the same as arrays, however a list can hold elements of multiple different data types

Lists are mutable - can add, modify, subtract elements.
Tuples are immutable - cannot add, modify, or subtract elements. However you can assign tuples to other tuples
For example - 
tuple3 = tuple4
Also, tuples are defined with parentheses
Example - 
tuple = (12, 23)

Dictionaries -
Key-value pairs that are modifiable

Classes -
Similiar to C++

Indentation is everything in python
