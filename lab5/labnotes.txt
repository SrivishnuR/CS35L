Lab 5 Log

For the transcrliteration program, we need to do three things
1) Check if length(from) = length(to)
2) Check if every byte in from is unique
3) Read from stdin -> transliterate -> write to stdout

To get arguments in a C program, we say 
int main(int argc, char** argv)
argc is the ammount of arguments and argv is array of arguments

To compile a C program we do
gcc program.c -o program
and then
./program

Just answer questions in lab file

STRACE
to generate file of given size

dd if=/dev/urandom of=file.txt bs=5120 count=1000

Strace
strace -o b1.txt ./tr2b from to < file.txt
